# eCommerceVisualizations

I have analyzed historical sales dataset to understand and project online sales of our
business around the world. The company spans 13 different regions with overall revenue of $12.64M
in 4 years with its operation mainly into three different categories i.e. Furniture, Technology, Office
Supplies with the profitability of $1.47M and 1590 customers in more than 3500 cities. The dataset
includes attributes such as user-id, sales price, discount, shipping cost, order priority to help us map
the sales ecosystem of our company. Our customers mainly include consumers, enterprises and
other small businesses. In this study, we will try to shed more light on factors like discount-profit
relations, Average Order Value of subcategories and areas that have opportunities for improvement
in sales and generating profits. We've also estimated next year's sales projection across segments,
which can help the management to target the right customers with tailored offers for a better
financial year. Additionally, this data has been used to analyze customers buying patterns and
preferences to generate better recommendation algorithms to implement strategies like combo deal
offers to drive sales and profit.
